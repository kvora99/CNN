<p>I am using the Sequential model from Keras to form the Neural Network. Sequential Model is used to construct simple models with linear stack of layers.</p>
<p>I got an accuracy of 86% after finishing the training process. If you need a higer accuracy, you could adjust the network achitectures and training parameters</p>
