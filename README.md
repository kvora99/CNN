<p>I am using the Sequential model from Keras to form the Neural Network. Sequential Model is used to construct simple models with linear stack of layers.</p>
<p>I got an accuracy of 86% after finishing the training process. If you need a higher accuracy, you can adjust the network architecture and training parameters. You can also use pretrained weights which i have uploaded.</p>
<p>To run code properly in your pc install requirements.txt file: 
  <blockquote>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</blockquote>
