<p>I am using the Sequential model from Keras to form the Neural Network. Sequential Model is used to construct simple models with linear stack of layers.</p>
<p>I got an accuracy of 86% after finishing the training process. If you need a higher accuracy, you can adjust the network architecture and training parameters</p>
